ctaplot is a collection of functions to produce instrument response functions (IRF) and reconstruction quality-checks metrics and plots for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes such as CTA

Given a list of reconstructed and simulated quantities, compute and plot metric and Instrument Response Functions such as:

* charge resolution
* ROC curves
* angular resolution
* energy resolution
* effective surface
* impact point resolution


You may find examples in the `documentation <https://ctaplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.     
Or you can run a simple one here:

The CTA instrument response functions data used in ctaplot come from the CTA Consortium and Observatory and may be found on the `cta-observatory website <http://www.cta-observatory.org/science/cta-performance/>`_ .

In cases for which the CTA instrument response functions are used in a research project, we ask to add the following acknowledgement in any resulting publication:    

“This research has made use of the CTA instrument response functions provided by the CTA Consortium and Observatory, see http://www.cta-observatory.org/science/cta-performance/ (version prod3b-v2) for more details.”

Install
=======


Requirements packages:

* python > 3.6
* numpy  
* scipy>=0.19    
* matplotlib>=2.0
* astropy

We recommend the use of `anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com>`_

The package is available through pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install ctaplot


.. code-block:: bash

    export GAMMABOARD_DATA=path_to_the_data_directory


We recommend that you add this line to your bash source file (`$HOME/.bashrc` or `$HOME/.bash_profile`)



GammaBoard
==========

*A dashboard to show them all.*


GammaBoard is a simple jupyter dashboard thought to display metrics assessing the reconstructions performances of
Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs).
Deep learning is a lot about bookkeeping and trials and errors. GammaBoard ease this bookkeeping and allows quick
comparison of the reconstruction performances of your machine learning experiments.

It is a working prototype used in CTA, especially by the [GammaLearn](https://gitlab.lapp.in2p3.fr/GammaLearn/) project.


Run GammaBoard
--------------

To launch the dashboard, you can simply try the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    gammaboard

This will run a temporary copy of the dashboard (a jupyter notebook).
Local changes that you make in the dashboard will be discarded afterwards.

GammaBoard is using data in a specific directory storing all your experiments files.
This directory is known under `$GAMMABOARD_DATA` by default.
However, you can change the path access at any time in the dashboard itself.

Demo
----

Here is a simple demo of GammaBoard:  

* On top the plots (metrics) such as angular resolution and energy resolution.
* Below, the list of experiments in the user folder.

When an experiment is selected in the list, the data is automatically loaded, the metrics computed and displayed.
A list of information provided during the training phase is also displayed.
As many experiments results can be overlaid.
When an experiment is deselected, it simply is removed from the plots.
